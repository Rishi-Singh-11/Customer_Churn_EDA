# **Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecommunications Company**

This project focuses on understanding the factors influencing customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The insights gained can help the company implement strategies to improve customer retention.

---

## **Key Findings**

### **Add-On Services**
- **Underutilized Services:** Many customers lack subscriptions to online security, backup, device protection, or tech support, leading to higher churn.  
- **Streaming Services:** Customers with streaming services are less likely to churn, indicating added value.  

### **Contracts and Billing**
- **Contracts:** Month-to-month contracts are the most common but have the highest churn rates.  
- **Payment Methods:** Customers paying via electronic checks churn the most.  
- **Paperless Billing:** Customers on paperless billing churn more, potentially due to dissatisfaction with digital-only interactions.  

### **Billing and Tenure**
- **Monthly Charges:** Customers paying above the average monthly charge of USD 64.78 churn more frequently.  
- **Tenure:** Newer customers (1â€“12 months) churn the most, emphasizing the importance of early engagement.

- Use targeted campaigns to upsell underutilized services.  

### **Optimize Pricing and Quality**

- Offer competitive plans for high-paying customers.  

### **Encourage Long-Term Commitments**
- Provide incentives for customers to switch from month-to-month plans to 1- or 2-year contracts.  

### **Improve Billing Experience**
- Encourage automated payment methods like credit cards or bank transfers over electronic checks.  
- Enhance the user experience for paperless billing to reduce churn.
