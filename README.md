# Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecommunications Company
This project focuses on understanding the factors influencing customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA). The insights gained can help the company implement strategies to improve customer retention.
<br>
## Objective
To analyze customer attributes such as demographics, service usage, billing details, and tenure to uncover patterns and trends associated with churn.
<br>
### Key Findings
#### Demographics
Gender: Churn rates are balanced, indicating no significant influence.
Senior Citizens: Older customers churn more frequently.
Partner and Dependents: Single customers without partners or dependents are more likely to churn.
Service Usage
Phone Services: Widely used, but customers without multiple lines churn slightly more.
Internet Services: Fiber optic users have the highest churn rates, likely due to pricing or quality concerns.
Add-On Services
Underutilized Services: Many customers lack subscriptions to online security, backup, device protection, or tech support, leading to higher churn.
Streaming Services: Customers with streaming services are less likely to churn, indicating added value.
Contracts and Billing
Contracts: Month-to-month contracts are the most common but have the highest churn rates.
Payment Methods: Customers paying via electronic checks churn the most.
Paperless Billing: Customers on paperless billing churn more, potentially due to dissatisfaction with digital-only interactions.
Billing and Tenure
Monthly Charges: Customers paying above the average monthly charge of USD 64.78 churn more frequently.
Tenure: Newer customers (1â€“12 months) churn the most, emphasizing the importance of early engagement.
